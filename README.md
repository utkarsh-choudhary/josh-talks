This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Task Management App

A simple task management application built with Next.js, Material UI, and TypeScript. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks with dynamic sorting by priority. It utilizes server-side rendering (SSR) for loading the initial list of tasks.

## Features

1. **Add a New Task**: Users can create a new task with a title, description, and priority (high, medium, low).
2. **Edit a Task**: Users can update the title, description, and priority of existing tasks.
3. **Mark Task as Completed**: Users can toggle the status of tasks between completed and pending.
4. **Delete a Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
5. **Sort Tasks**: Tasks are dynamically sorted by priority, with high priority tasks displayed at the top.
6. **Responsive Design**: The app features a basic responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Material UI, TypeScript
- **State Management**: Local state for managing tasks
- **Styling**: Material UI for UI components and CSS for responsive design

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utkarsh-choudhary/josh-talks.git
